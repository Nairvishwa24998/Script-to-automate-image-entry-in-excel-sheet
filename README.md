# Script-to-automate-image-entry-in-excel-sheet
The purpose of this script was to insert images of students into the cells, next to their names in a particular excel sheet as part of a placement related form submission. 

The filenames were the names of students, and filecheck is to be used to change the names in the excel sheet to the filenames to prevent errors later. 

Note: 
1) The filecheck.py is only a means to ensure the names under the names collumns in the excel sheet are in the format you need
2) filecheck.py needs to be run first, unless the names are matching beforehand.
3) The variables filename and filelocation used in both files(only relevant if you run both) should be given the same values across both files(i.e. filename and filelocation should have their respective values stay constant across across both the files)
