# Script-to-automate-image-entry-in-excel-sheet
The purpose of this script was to insert images of students into the cells, next to their names in a particular excel sheet. 
The filenames were the names of students, and filecheck is to be used to change the names in the excel sheet to the filenames to prevent errors later. 

Note: 
1) The filecheck.py is only a means to ensure the names under the names collumns in the excel sheet are in the format you need
2) filecheck.py needs to be run first, in case you do wish to run it.
3) The variables filename and filelocation used in both files(only relevant if you run both) should be given the same values across both files(i.e. filename should have the same value across both the files and filelocation should have the same value across both the files)
